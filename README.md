I'm Aki, and I had a rough start as a programmer.
About me in a nutshell:

- I'm 21
- I started with Python
- I'm 100% self-taught
- I'm trying to get into Rust to have an alternative to Python when I need something compiled and fast
- I'm german, but I speak more English in day-to-day life

## My (rough) start as a programmer

I'm 100% self-taught, even though I was in an apprenticeship for two years.

The summary is that I was with one company for my first year. That company never taught me anything and made me do tasks unrelated to being a programmer. I didn't even have an actual programmer in my department. My mentor was an average tech support person who had never programmed a thing in their life.
I got fed up with this, mainly because I talked to my employer and asked them to change this obvious problem, and they refused repeatedly. I started refusing to do simple tasks and taught myself Python.

After about a year, I switched to a new company, which promised to be better. And they were, but not by a whole lot. My new problem was that the stuff I taught myself while I was at the first company had already surpassed the capabilities of my new company. They weren't a programming company, but they were a tech company. So I was stuck doing little things that didn't challenge me, and soon I discovered that I was probably the most capable Python programmer in the company. I got the biggest projects with the most responsibility. However, even that was too easy since it wasn't anything serious, just some gadgets to automate little things here and there.

After two years of 40h a week for less than minimum wage, with the burning desire to learn more and get better, I had a burnout. No wonder with a situation like that.

I quit the apprenticeship and started learning with the 42 School, which was fine initially. However, after just a few months, I noticed that I never gave myself a chance to recover from burnout. I eventually was again wholly drained and had no choice but to quit.

So now I'm at home, with a diagnosed burnout and the feeling that I can't rely on anyone to teach me beside myself.

## What I'm currently doing

At the moment, I'm at home. I'm trying to get my head into a working schedule again with things like LeetCode and small personal projects.
The current plan is to take these LeetCode problems and other stuff I made at home and use them as a portfolio whenever I feel ready for a working environment again.
